Some believe it might be caused genetically, but scientists have been unable to pinpoint the actual reasons. What is known, however, is that it affects four times more men than women, and that 25% of all children go through a stage of development during which they stutter.

Before then, they were seen as fairly similar.

Romulus and Remus, the legendary twin founders of Rome, were supposed to have been cared for by wolves. The idea actually became believable in the late 19th century when a French doctor found a naked ten-year-old boy wandering in the woods. He did not walk upright, could not speak intelligently, nor relate to people: he only growled like a wolf and stared at them. Finally, the doctor won the boy's confidence and began to work with him. After many long years of devoted and patient instruction, the doctor was able to get the boy to clothe and feed himself, recognize and say a number of words, and even to write a little.",

The tribe consisted of 24 people, with completely unique customs and language. They displayed no aggressive tendencies, either to outsiders or each other. They reached decisions at informal meetings at which men and women spoke equally. Age alone commanded respect. They lived a nomadic existence and knew nothing of farming. Living mostly on wild potatoes, fruits, and bamboo shoots, the Tasaday derived some protein from crabs and small fish. Monkey meat was considered a delicacy to be brought out only on special occasions. Although they appeared in good health, they practiced no medicine and confessed to leaving the sick to die.",

The two other important sacred books are the Talmud and the Torah, which contain the many laws and observances orthodox Jews are supposed to keep. The principal festival is the Feast of Passover; the principal place of worship is the synagogue and the priests are called Rabbis.
